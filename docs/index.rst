Welcome to DDT's documentation!
===============================

DDT (Data-Driven Tests) allows you to multiply one test by running it with
different test data, and make it appear as multiple tests.

You can find (and fork) the project in https://github.com/txels/ddt.

DDT should work on Python2 and Python3, but we only officially test it for
versions 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4.
